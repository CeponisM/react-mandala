## Overview

React Mandala combines the power of React and p5.js to generate beautiful, mathematically-inspired patterns based on circular motion, mathematical constants (like œÄ and the golden ratio), and customizable equations. Users can manipulate various parameters to create unique visual effects resembling mandalas or spirograph-like patterns.

The project features a responsive canvas with interactive controls, preset configurations, zoom functionality, and touch support for mobile devices, allowing users to explore mathematical beauty through dynamic animations and color variations.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Canvas**: Animated patterns rendered with p5.js using two circles moving based on user-defined parameters
- **Mathematical Modes**: Predefined equations (œÄ, golden ratio, Mandelbrot-inspired) and custom user-defined equations
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Motion parameters: speed, distance, pivot distance, initial separation
  - Animation controls: start/stop, rotation, rotation speed
  - Color options: dynamic or fixed color modes, hue animation, blend mode (difference)
  - Background customization: color, brightness, animation, and inversion
- **Presets**: Five predefined configurations for quick pattern exploration
- **Randomization**: Generate random settings for unique visual outputs
- **Touch Support**: Pinch-to-zoom functionality for mobile devices
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with automatic canvas resizing

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ceponism/react-mandala.git
   cd react-mandala
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will open at `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

4. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

### Getting Started
1. Open the app in your browser
2. You'll see a canvas displaying animated patterns with a control menu on the left
3. Use the `<</>>` button to show/hide the control menu

### Control Menu Options

- **Presets**: Select from five preset configurations or randomize settings
- **Equation Menu**: Choose predefined modes (œÄ, golden ratio, Mandelbrot) or enter custom equations
- **Animation Menu**: Start/stop animation and adjust rotation speed
- **Line Color Menu**: Toggle dynamic/fixed colors, adjust hue, enable blend modes
- **Background Color Menu**: Customize background color, brightness, and animation
- **Invert Background**: Toggle color inversion for different visual effects

### Interactivity

- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out on the canvas
- **Touch Gestures**: Pinch to zoom on mobile devices
- **Custom Equations**: Enter equations using `x`, `y`, `pi`, and standard operators (e.g., `pi * x + y`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

- **React** (^18.2.0): User interface framework for building the interactive control menu and managing state.
- **p5** (^1.8.0): JavaScript library for rendering the interactive canvas and animating mandala-like patterns.
- **mathjs** (^13.2.0): Math library for parsing and evaluating custom mathematical equations, enabling complex expressions like `sin` and `cos` in custom mode.
- **react-scripts** (5.0.1): Development and build tools for running and bundling the React application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### App.js
- Manages application state (mode, speed, color settings)
- Renders control menu and Canvas component
- Includes preset configurations and random pattern generation
- Handles background color animation with useEffect

### Canvas.js
- Uses p5.js to render animated patterns
- Two circles move based on user parameters with paths drawn on canvas
- Supports mathematical modes and custom equation parsing
- Handles zoom via mouse wheel and touch gestures
- Manages color changes and canvas scaling

### Custom Equations
Users can input custom equations using the format:
- `x`, `y` for variables
- `pi` for œÄ constant
- Standard operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`)
- Example: `pi * x + y`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Custom Equation Parsing**: Limited parsing capabilities; use simple expressions
- **Performance**: High speeds or large distances may impact performance on low-end devices
- **Mandelbrot Mode**: Simplified implementation, not a full Mandelbrot set
- **Touch Support**: Only pinch-to-zoom is supported (no panning)

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- [x] Enhance equation parsing with safer math library (e.g., mathjs)
- [x] Add panning support for touch and mouse interactions
- [ ] Implement more complex mathematical modes and fractal patterns
- [ ] Optimize performance for high-speed animations
- [ ] Add export functionality for saving patterns as images/videos
